# Description
This repo contains three papers that were written for the International Modelling Challenge (2020 - 2021 edition). The first two represent our team's anwers for the two tasks that were submitted for the two initial selection phases in a national scale. The third paper is then our solution for the problem that was internationally proposed. We can proudly say that this solution awarded us a honorable mention in this international competition.

## Remarks
It is interesting that the first two problems that were intended to be solved nationally were the only ones that actually required programming tools. The third problem used only a few lines of code, which actually served as an auxiliary code for an excel sheet.
